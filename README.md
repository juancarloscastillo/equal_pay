Chapter handbook equal pay.

## Request mail:

I am Anders Örtenblad, a Swedish scholar working at a university in Norway. The reason why I contact you is that I have a book series (for Palgrave Macmillan) that publishes anthologies of a “debating” format, that is, in each book scholars debate a common theme (for instance, some may be “for”, others “against”, and yet others “in between for and against”). I am about to start up a project on an anthology on “equal payment for all”, that is, where scholars debate the reasonable and valuable in letting all people – no matter what they work with (and even if they don’t have a job) – have the exact same compensation. If arguing against equal pay for all, then one could clarify which parameters that should be used to decide salaries (such as “the market”, “level of responsibility”, “length of education” etc.)  I have found online that you have touched upon similar topics in your previous writings, and for this reason I was wondering if you maybe would like to contribute to the book with a chapter?

## Initial prpoposal

thanks for the consideration to participate in this volume. What I think that can be a contribution from my side is an analysis of justice perceptions and preferences of salary gaps in different countries based on survey data such as the ISSP. What I have found so far is that overall people prefer equality in general terms, but when it comes to salary gaps there are many contradictions.
