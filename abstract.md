# Just but unequal salaries: The role of meritocratic beliefs on pay differentials in international comparison.

The growing income concentration has brought about several concerns regarding the fairness of economic differences. Whereas in general terms equality seems to be a justice ideal, on the other hand the differences in income are largely justified based on meritocratic norms of personal effort and talent. In this regard: Â¿Are meritocratic beliefs related with differences in justification of unequal payment? Using the last inequality module of the International Social Survey Programme, this chapter begins describing the justification of salary gaps over 40 countries followed by models that use meritocratic beliefs as predictors of just gaps. Using multilevel estimation, we put the focus on how countries differ in the association between meritocratic beliefs and just salary gaps, and on to what extent this is related to the countries income inequality levels.
