# Just but unequal salaries: The role of meritocratic beliefs on pay differentials over time.

Juan Carlos Castillo, Luis Maldonado, Julio Iturra & Cristóbal Moya.

The growing income concentration has brought about several concerns regarding the fairness of economic differences. Whereas in general terms equality seems to be a justice ideal, on the other hand the differences in income are largely justified based on meritocratic norms of personal effort and talent. In this regard: ¿Are meritocratic beliefs related with differences in justification of unequal payment? Using the socil inequality module of the International Social Survey Programme for 1999, 2009 and 2019, this chapter begins describing the justification of salary gaps over 20 years in Chile followed by models that use meritocratic beliefs as predictors of just gaps. A focus of this chapter are the changes in the association between meritocratic beliefs and just salary gaps over time.
